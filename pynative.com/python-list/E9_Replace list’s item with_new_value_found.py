# Exercise 9: 
# Replace listâ€™s item with new value if found

# You have given a Python list. Write a program to find value 20 in the list, 
# and if it is present, replace it with 200. Only update the first occurrence of an item.

# Given:
# list1 = [5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 50, 20]

# Expected output
# [5, 10, 15, 200, 25, 50, 20]

list1 = [5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 50, 20]

ind = list1.index(20)
list1.insert(ind,200)
print(list1)
