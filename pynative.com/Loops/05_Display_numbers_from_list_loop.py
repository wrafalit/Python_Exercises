# Exercise 5:
# Display numbers from a list using loop

# Write a program to display only those numbers from a list that satisfy the following conditions

#     The number must be divisible by five
#     If the number is greater than 150, then skip it and move to the next number
#     If the number is greater than 500, then stop the loop

# Given: numbers = [12, 75, 150, 180, 145, 525, 50]

# Expected output: 
# 75
# 150
# 145
