# Exercise 11: 
# Write a program to display all prime numbers within a range

# Note: A Prime Number is a number that cannot be made by multiplying other whole numbers. 
# A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that is not a product of two smaller natural numbers

# Examples:

#     6 is not a prime mumber because it can be made by 2Ã—3 = 6
#     37 is a prime number because no other whole numbers multiply together to make it.

# Given:

# # range
# start = 25
# end = 50

# Expected output:

# Prime numbers between 25 and 50 are:
# 29
# 31
# 37
# 41
# 43
# 47
