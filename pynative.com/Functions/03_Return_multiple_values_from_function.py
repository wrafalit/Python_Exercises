# Exercise 3: 
# Return multiple values from a function

# Write a program to create function calculation() such that it can accept two variables and calculate addition and subtraction. Also, it must return both addition and subtraction in a single return call.

# Given:

# def calculation(a, b):
#     # Your Code

# res = calculation(40, 10)
# print(res)

# Expected Output : 50, 30

def calculation(a, b):
    add = a + b
    sub = a - b
    return add, sub

res = calculation(40, 10)
print(res)
