#  List Comprehensions
# 
# Let’s say I give you a list saved in a variable: a = [1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100]. 
# Write one line of Python that takes this list a and makes a new list that has only the even elements of this list in it.

a = [1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100]
print('list number: ' ,a)
print('even number: ',[x for x in a if x % 2 == 0])

# Extra exercise
# print('odd number: ',[x for x in a if x % 2 != 0])
# print('add 2 to number: ',[x+2 for x in a])
